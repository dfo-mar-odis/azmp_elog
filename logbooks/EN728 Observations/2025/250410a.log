========================================
Switched inflow to underway system from the impeller pump to the diaphragm pump as the impeller pump continued to shut off. No impacts to the IFCB are expected as the underway is connected to the outflow from the IFCB, and the flow rate to the underway is better than it was when using the impeller pump. Consider this set up if we use the vessel next year.
